## Project Overview
The **NeverToLate** web platform delivers a clean, accessible, and highly structured multi-page experience built with core web development standards. The site represents the brand's identity—from its legacy origins to its modern streetwear identity—featuring interactive product showcases, dynamic hover animations, store locators with map embeds, and media integration.

---

## Key Features
- **3-Column Header Architecture:** Balances legacy (`oldlogo.png`) and modern (`newlogo.png`) brand identities with full central navigation and action controls.
- **Interactive Sliding Curtain Navigation:** Pure CSS hover animations (`::before` sliding pseudo-elements) accompanied by attribute-driven tooltip popups (`data-tooltip`).
- **Responsive Product Catalog Grid:** Dynamic CSS Grid layout (`repeat(4, 1fr)`) auto-adjusting across 4-column, 3-column, 2-column, and single-column displays for mobile devices.
- **Store Locator Integration:** Interactive Google Maps (`iframe`) embeds alongside physical store listings for Akasia Mall and Menlyn Mall.
- **Embedded Media:** Showcase brand video playback (`_video/mortivation.mp4`) with loop, muted autoplay, and poster controls on the About page.
- **Interactive Customer Enquiry Interface:** Form controls with real-time focus feedback and animated submission actions.
- **Content Protection:** Integrated protection script (`js/protection.js`) linked across all web pages.

### Changed
- **Code comments across all pages** — added explanatory HTML comments to `about.html`, `contact.html`, `enquiries.html`, `index.html`, and `product.html` for better readability and to make others to understand my code.
- **`product.html`**

### Added

---

## 2026-09-14

### Added
- **Code comments across all pages** — added explanatory HTML comments to `about.css`, `contact.css`, `enquiries.css`, `index.css`, and `product.css` for better readability and to make others to understand my code.

### Changed
 - **Product Catalog Layout (`contact.html` & `contact.css`)**
 - Replaced the (table) based layout (.contact-table, td cells) with a flexbox layout (.contact-row, .map-cell, .images-cell, .details-cell).
 - Converted the (table,tr,td) structure to (div class="contact-row" , div class="map-cell")  to match the new flexbox CSS.
 - Removed a duplicate (/header) closing tag.
 - **main.css** — Widened the header-container from max-width: 1300px to max-width: 100% for full width of the web page.
 - Increased the header-logo img from 140px to 180px to make them a bit bigger and also to fit in the box.

## 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Active Page Indicator (`main.css` & nav buttons)**
  - Added a looping curtain animation (`@keyframes curtainLoop`, `@keyframes curtainTextLoop`) so the nav button for the current open page continuously cycles the white curtain open and closed, instead of only animating on hover.
  - Added `.active` class styling (`nav button.active`) with a black border to mark the current page's button.
  - Paused the loop animation on direct hover (`animation-play-state: paused`) so the active button still responds normally when a user hovers over it.
  - Added `class="active"` to the corresponding nav button on `about.html`, `product.html`, `enquiries.html`, and `contact.html` so each web page highlights its own nav item.
