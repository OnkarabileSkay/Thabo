# CHANGELOG

Changes for my NeverToLate Website

---

## 2026-09-05

### Changed
- **Header & Navigation Structure (`main.css` & HTML Headers)**
  - Refactored legacy Part 1 table-based header layout (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) to a modern, semantic `<div>` container system (`.header-container`).
  - Implemented 3-column CSS Grid header structure (`grid-template-columns: 180px 1fr 180px`) balancing the legacy logo (`oldlogo.png`), central branding/navigation, and new logo (`newlogo.png`).
  - Implemented mobile and tablet media query breakpoints (`1024px` and `768px`) that reflow the 3-column header into a vertical layout with full-width stacked navigation buttons.

## 2026-09-06

### Changed 
- **Product Catalog Layout (`product.html` & `product.css`)**
  - Converted product display markup from Part 1 table rows and cells (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) into modular `<div>` card elements (`.product-card`, `.product-grid`).
  - Converted table markup into a responsive CSS Grid system (`display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)`) to display equal-width product cards across desktop viewports.
  - Styled product cards with subtle borders, background fills, hover lift effects, uniform image containers (`height: 220px`, `object-fit: contain`), and typography rules for product titles, prices, and fabric descriptions.
  - Added responsive layout breakpoints for 3-column (`1050px`), 2-column (`768px`), and 1-column (`500px`) displays.

### Changed

## 2026-09-12

### Changed
- **Code comments across all pages** — added explanatory HTML comments to `about.html`, `contact.html`, `enquiries.html`, `index.html`, and `product.html` for better readability and to make others to understand my code.
- **`product.html`**

---

## 2026-09-14

### Added
- **Code comments across all pages** — added explanatory HTML comments to `about.css`, `contact.css`, `enquiries.css`, `index.css`, and `product.css` for better readability and to make others to understand my code.

### Changed
 - **Product Catalog Layout (`contact.html` & `contact.css`)**
 - Replaced the (table) based layout (.contact-table, td cells) with a flexbox layout (.contact-row, .map-cell, .images-cell, .details-cell).
 - Converted the (table,tr,td) structure to (div class="contact-row" , div class="map-cell")  to match the new flexbox CSS.
 - Removed a duplicate (/header) closing tag.
 - **main.css** — Widened the header-container from max-width: 1300px to max-width: 100% for full width of the web page.
 - Increased the header-logo img from 140px to 180px to make them a bit bigger and also to fit in the box.

## 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Active Page Indicator (`main.css` & nav buttons)**
  - Added a looping curtain animation (`@keyframes curtainLoop`, `@keyframes curtainTextLoop`) so the nav button for the current open page continuously cycles the white curtain open and closed, instead of only animating on hover.
  - Added `.active` class styling (`nav button.active`) with a black border to mark the current page's button.
  - Paused the loop animation on direct hover (`animation-play-state: paused`) so the active button still responds normally when a user hovers over it.
  - Added `class="active"` to the corresponding nav button on `about.html`, `product.html`, `enquiries.html`, and `contact.html` so each web page highlights its own nav item.
